demoblazetest project
=====================

In order to design and implement the test, It has been divided the test in two parts:
1.- navigate_demoblaze_test.feature
2.- simulate_user_experience.feature

The first one is used to assure the navigation through the web, focusing on product categories.
The second one is used to simulate the user experience buying a product, subdivided in 3 cases:
	1.- add a product to cart
	2.- having two products in cart, delete one specific product
	3.- having a product in cart, finish the purchase process


Execution instructions:
=======================

In order to launch the tests, it's needed to set the path to the geckodriver when using maven, 
therefore, use the next launch command in the main folder:

_$ mvn test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/geckodriver


How to approach testing this site in a real project
====================================================

The test should be as short as possible and re-usably, therefore the best approach should be divide the 
user experience in small tests:
- assert link navigation through the web
- assert access to product information
- assert add product to cart
- assert delete product from cart (one product, several, just one from several, etc)
- assert purchase process, checking all the fields required (assert mandatory fields, type of fields, 
		 length, etc) and assert information displayed to user (amount, data filled by user, etc)
- assert user sessions

In order to do this tests, the code should have a good library set, in order to work better with error managements, 
product information and web navigation helpers.
